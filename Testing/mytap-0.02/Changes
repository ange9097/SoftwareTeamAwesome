Revision history for MyTAP
==========================

0.02  2010-08-30T17:36:29
-------------------------
* Modified exception-throwing code to always clear out the cached data before
  dying. Doesn't cover cases where the code being tested dies, but at least it
  covers our own intentional deaths.
* Fixed `DROP` lines to be terminated with "//" instead of ";". Seems like
  some versions of MySQl didn't mind the semicolon, but others did.


0.01  2010-07-28T18:37:03
-------------------------
* Initial public release with core functionality ported from
  [pgTAP](http://pgtap.org/).
